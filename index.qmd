Hi, I’m Alin! Welcome to my website. I will be using this site as a way to display some of my work and interests. You can find some of my projects, talks, and the occasional blog post about stuff I’ve found cool and thought was worth sharing.

# A bit about me

I am a PhD student at Lancaster University in the UK, currently supervised by [Prof. Chris Jewell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BF1RFL8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Paul Fearnhead](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=_21NhC8AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on computational challenges for fitting stochastic epidemic models, specifically MCMC algorithms spatio-temporal models for spread of disease. 

## Research interests

### Epidemic modelling
Epidemic models provide useful insight into how we can manage the spread of disease in both human and animal populations. They can be powerful tools for public policy and pose interesting computational challenges.

### Likelihood inference and MCMC
Bayesian methods provide robust estimation for complex models where analytical solutions are often infeasible. They allow for exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces

### Parallel and high performance computing
One of the best ways to increase the efficiency of fitting models is to take advantage of modern hardware like GPUs and HPC clusters. This can be done by implementing algorithms so they can be run in parallel across more than one device.

## Personal and hobbies

### Cycling
A very famous man once said "I like to ride my bicycle" and I think he was on to something there.

### Photography
I take picture... mostly with a very little camera.
