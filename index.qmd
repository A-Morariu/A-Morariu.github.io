Hi, I’m Alin! Welcome to my website. I will be using this site as a way to display some of my work and interests. You can find some of my projects, talks, and the occasional blog post about stuff I’ve found cool and thought was worth sharing.

# A bit about me

I am a PhD student at Lancaster University in the North West of the UK, currently supervised by Prof. Chris Jewell and Prof. Paul Fearnhead. My research focuses on computational challenges for fitting stochastic epidemic models, specifically MCMC algorithms which find parameter values and estimate missing data for spatio-temporal models.

# Main interests 
## Research interests

### Epidemic modelling
Epidemic models provide useful insight into how we can manage the spread of disease in both human and animal populations. They can be powerful tools for public policy and pose interesting computational challenges.

### Cycling
A very famous man once said "I like to ride my bicycle" and I think he was on to something there.
