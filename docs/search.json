You can find some of my projects, talks, and the occasional blog post about stuff I’ve found cool and thought was worth sharing.\n\nA bit about me\nI am a PhD student at Lancaster University in the North West of the UK, currently supervised by Prof. Chris Jewell and Prof. Paul Fearnhead. My research focuses on computational challenges for fitting stochastic epidemic models, specifically MCMC algorithms which find parameter values and estimate missing data for spatio-temporal models.\n\n\nMain interests\n\nEpidemic modelling\nLikelihood inference and MCMC algorithms\nParallel and cloud computing\nSoftware engineering\nTeaching statistics\nCycling\n\nIf you have any questions about these please get in touch!"
