I'm a PhD student at Lancaster University with an interest in Bayesian statistics and all the computational aspects that come along with that. This includes inference algorithms like MCMC, probablistic programming, efficient implementations, and software for making this more accessible. In the past, I've worked as a data scientist and analyst in the finance industry as well as a researcher in a hospital.
