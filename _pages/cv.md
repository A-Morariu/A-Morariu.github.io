Since I come from North America, we make a point to distinguish between our
_resume_ and our _CV_. It seems silly but here we are... both of them can be
found on this page.

What are the differences you may wonder? Here's what I've gathered over the
years:

| Resume                                                    |                             CV                              |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
| - Bullet point form focusing on your achievements in jobs |               -Full details of every position               |
| -Format is up to you! Make it your own                    | -Rigid/"boring" format - make it easy to read top to bottom |
