Hi, I'm Alin! Welcome to my website. I will be using this site as a way to
display some of my work and interests. You can find some of my projects, talks,
and the occasional blog post about stuff I've found cool and thought was worth
sharing.

## A bit about me

I am a PhD student at Lancaster University in the North West of the UK,
currently supervised by Prof. Chris Jewell and Prof. Paul Fearnhead. My research
focuses on computational challenges for fitting stochastic epidemic models,
specifically MCMC algorithms which find parameter values and estimate missing
data for spatio-temporal models.

## Core interests

1. Epidemic modelling
2. MCMC algorithms
3. Parallel and cloud computing
4. Software engineering
5. Teaching statistics
