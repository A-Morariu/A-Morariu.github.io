For a lot of the teaching I do, I like to keep a little "blog" of sorts. These
can all be found on this page. Look for the course code and title in the correct
year/term to find the relevant material. Material in the posts dates back
several years in certain cases, so it is not always up to date however it may
still be relevant or interesting to look at. 

{% include base_path %} 

{% for post in site.teaching reversed %} 

{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
